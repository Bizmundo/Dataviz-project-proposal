# WPI CS573 Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the [stop and search data of Kent (UK) police](https://gist.github.com/Bizmundo/246821fffd9f3ed3c1c25f515be6eb6e).

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a bar chart that shows the proportion of the stop and search type by race.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Is there any correlation between stop and search type and race?
 * Is there any correlation between object of search and race?
 * Is there any relationship between stop and search outcome and race?
 * Is there any spacial pattern on the location of the stops and searches?
 * How does the temporal trend of the stop and search look?

## Sketches

Below are the sketches of the charts  that will helps answer the questions above.

### The bar chart
It displays the percentage of an attribute by race. It has Combo box that helps the user select the attribute of instrest.

### The Kent (UK) map
It displays the location of the stop and search on the map. It has a combo box that helps the user overlay other attributes on the map. The slider helps observe the trend of the spatial positions of the stop and search over time.

## Open Questions
I am not sure that the map of Kent is available in a format will ease the vizulization of this data.
