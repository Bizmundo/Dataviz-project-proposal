# WPI CS573 Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the [stop and search data of Kent (UK) police](https://gist.github.com/Bizmundo/246821fffd9f3ed3c1c25f515be6eb6e).

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a bar chart that shows the proportion of the stop and search type by race.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Is there any correlation between stop and search type and race?
 * Is there any correlation between object of search and race?
 * Is there any relationship between stop and search outcome and race?
 * Is there any spacial pattern on the location of the stops and searches?
 * How does the temporal trend of the stop and search look?

## Sketches

Below are the sketches of the charts  that will helps answer the questions above.

### The bar chart
It displays the percentage of an attribute by race. It has Combo box that helps the user select the attribute of instrest.
### The Kent (UK) map
It displays the location of the stop and search on the map. It will have a combo box that will help the user overlay other attributes on the map. The slider will help observe the trend of the spatial positions of the stop and search over time.

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)
